## Slope test: uphill vs downhill at matched speed, in ball sizes

s = (downhill - uphill acceleration along the motion) / 2 at matched speed, in ball diameters per step² (1 step = 1/8 s); friction cancels. Positions are mapped onto the table with the ball's size (camera calibration from real frames only). Clips: one fit per clip over its longest run of 5+ target steps on open table; open = the open-table clips (scripts/cut_open_clips.py, scored only), plank = the plank clips' target steps. See models/vjepa2/slope_test.py.

Calibration: radius = -0.0015 x + 0.0392 y + 13.49 px (R² 0.925, 13776 frames; radius [14.97, 29.28] px across the table).

### Learning curve (C: both directions, loss-weighted sampling)

| epoch | s, open clips | 95% CI | s, plank clips | 95% CI | AUROC ball from R | AUROC ball from L |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | None | None | None | None | 0.437 | 0.66 |

Imagined paths count only target steps where the imagined ball is clearly visible (map peak >= 0.2) on open table, so n shows how often the model draws the ball at all. Figures: `slope_test/epochs.png`, `slope_test/real_acc_vs_speed.png`.
